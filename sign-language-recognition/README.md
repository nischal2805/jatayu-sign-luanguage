# Sign Language Recognition Project

This project implements a sign language recognition system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately recognize and classify sign language gestures from images or video input.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- **data/**: Contains raw and processed datasets.
  - **raw/**: Holds the original datasets used for training and testing.
  - **processed/**: Contains datasets that have been processed and are ready for model training and evaluation.

- **models/**: Implements the sign language classifier.
  - **classifier.py**: Contains classes and methods for training and predicting sign language gestures.

- **notebooks/**: Includes Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
  - **exploratory_analysis.ipynb**: Used for visualizing the dataset and understanding features.

- **src/**: Contains the main source code for the project.
  - **config.py**: Configuration settings for paths and model parameters.
  - **data_processing/**: Functions for data preprocessing and augmentation.
    - **augmentation.py**: Data augmentation techniques.
    - **preprocessor.py**: Functions for normalizing and resizing images.
  - **features/**: Functions for feature extraction from images.
    - **extraction.py**: Extracts keypoints or descriptors from images.
  - **training/**: Logic for training and validating the model.
    - **train.py**: Contains the training loop and loss calculation.
    - **validate.py**: Functions for model validation.
  - **utils/**: Utility functions for various tasks.
    - **image_utils.py**: Image processing utilities.
    - **visualization.py**: Functions for visualizing predictions and metrics.

- **tests/**: Contains unit tests for the project.
  - **test_data_processing.py**: Tests for data processing functions.
  - **test_model.py**: Tests for model functionality.

- **app.py**: Main entry point for the application, integrating all components.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project.
